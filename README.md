Project 3 for CSC365.  Assignment instructions are provided below.

Assignment 3:
Extend Assignment 2 to record connectivity across sites. As a connectivity check, report the number of spanning trees (for any arbitrary node as initial starting point). Store persistently (possibly just in a Serialized file). Use caching as appropriate to avoid unnecessary reconstruction.
Write a program (either GUI or web-based) that uses graph from step 1, allows a user to select any page, and displays graphically the shortest (weighted by any similarity metric) path between that page and the nearest (reachable) cluster center.
